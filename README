11/23/17 2:37 PM - Started working on the AI. Almost done writing the chasing state for the gator

11/23/17 4:35 PM - Continued the StudentController.java file on establishing original ghost behavior.

11/24/17 12:50 PM - Finished implementing the classic behavior for the ghosts in the
StudentController.java file. New goal is to further understand the behavior and analyze where we can improve
 the behavior to make it more aggressive without making it impossible for attackers.

11/24/17 1:02 PM - As of now, we will only be implementing the studentController.java file.
I have disabled the classic behavior from being used.

11/25/17 10:48 AM - I made a branch to test out the tweaks to the StudentController.java file.
So far I managed to change the exploreState method to always chase pacman. The problem now is
that the gators are so aggressive that sometimes they'll bunch up and when pacman picks up a
powerpill, pacman gets a lot of scores.

Try to figure out a way to have the ghosts start running away when pacman is hovering near a
power pill. That way it burns up the time while pacman can kill the gators and not score kills.

11/28/17 4:31 PM - Tweaked the getFutureState() within the killState class to make the ghosts a
little smarter.
